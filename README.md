## Features
1. **Object Tracking**: Detects and tracks players, referees, and the ball using YOLO.
2. **Camera Movement Estimation**: Compensates for dynamic camera motions to maintain accuracy.
3. **Perspective Transformation**: Converts object positions into real-world coordinates.
4. **Player Metrics**: Measures and annotates player speed and distance traveled.
5. **Team Assignment**: Automatically identifies and assigns team colors to players.
6. **Ball Possession Tracking**: Determines player and team ball possession over time.
7. **Comprehensive Video Annotation**: Generates an output video enriched with metrics and insights.

## Workflow

### Input
- A football match video in standard formats.

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Object Tracking**: Tracks players and the ball across video frames.
2. **Camera Motion Compensation**: Adjusts positions for a dynamic camera view.
3. **Perspective Transformation**: Converts positions to a top-down perspective.
4. **Player Metrics**: Estimates speed, distance, and positional dynamics.
5. **Team Assignment**: Identifies team colors and links players to teams.
6. **Ball Possession**: Detects which player and team control the ball.
7. **Video Annotation**: Adds all calculated metrics and insights onto the video frames.

### Output
- Annotated video with:
  - Player speeds (km/h) and distances covered (m).
  - Ball possession indicators for players and teams.
  - Camera movement and perspective transformations.

## Upgrading to a Grafana Dashboard

### Steps
1. **Live Streaming**:
   - Integrate RTSP feeds for real-time game tracking.
   - Use Kafka or RabbitMQ for efficient data streaming.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Store processed metrics in Prometheus or InfluxDB for time-series analysis.

3. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Visualize speed, distance, ball possession, and team stats in Grafana.
   - Implement advanced visualizations like heatmaps and player comparisons.

4. **Enhanced AI**:
   - Add models for tactical analysis, pass prediction, and fatigue estimation.

### Benefits
- Real-time insights for coaches, analysts, and fans.
- Interactive dashboards to analyze team and player performance.
- Scalable for professional-grade game analytics.
